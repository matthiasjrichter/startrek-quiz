# Star Trek Quiz
I built this for the #10DayWebBuild challenge

**See it in action here:** https://matthiasjrichter.github.io/startrek-quiz/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The design is based on https://www.thelcars.com/. But heavily modified.


## Optimizations

1. At the moment the questions are always the same. It would be nice to have a larger pool of questions and choose them randomly.
2. Users often requested to see the correct answer when they chose the wrong answer.
3. Currently if the user is quick enough they can click another answer before being forwarded to the next question.
4. A leaderboard would be a nice addition and would add some backend to this project.
5. The CSS code is very messy. There is a lot of unused CSS.


## Lessons Learned:

1. User feedback is super important. I thought I had thought of everything until I got reports from my non-technical beta testers.
2. https://www.thelcars.com/ is a really great template, but in hindsight it would have been easier to code the CSS from scratch and just copy and paste the relevant parts.
