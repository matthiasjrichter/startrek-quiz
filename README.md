# Star Trek Quiz
I built this for the #10DayWebBuild challenge

**Link to project:** https://matthiasjrichter.github.io/startrek-quiz/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The design is based on https://www.thelcars.com/. But heavily modified.


## Optimizations

At the moment the questions are always the same. It would be nice to have a larger pool of questions and choose them randomly.
Users often requested to see the correct answer when they chose the wrong answer.
A leaderboard would be a nice addition and would add some backend to this project.
The CSS code is very messy. There is a lot of unused CSS and I feel sorry for any programmer who wants to work with this abomination.


## Lessons Learned:

1. User feedback is super important. I thought I had thought of everything until I got reports from my non-technical beta testers.
2. https://www.thelcars.com/ is a really great template, but in hindsight it would have been easier to code the CSS from scratch and just copy and paste the relevant parts.
